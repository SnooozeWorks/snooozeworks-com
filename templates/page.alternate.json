My name is Daniel, and I started SnooozeWorks in late-2016 as a creative outlet to add a little self-fulfillment to my life. I was a Junior in college at the time, a late bloomer as they say, and needed to find a little happiness in what I was pursuing as a career. The early designs that I created before opening, or considering opening, SnooozeWorks helped me build a style, and the emotional uplift I received from finishing a piece let me know this is what I wanted to be doing with my life.<br\/><br\/>It started with a single poster design that's transformed into into almost 700 products across a multitude of types and styles. Throughout the first two years, I worked full-time during the day, in addition to attending college full-time in pursuit of a Bachelor's degree. It was a lot of late nights and early mornings designing, printing, making, attending to customer service, taking care of finances. Crazy long work weeks, but SnooozeWorks was my reprieve. It was my passion, and it felt like I was living in a dream every time I heard the little 'ding' of an order being placed.<\/p>"
